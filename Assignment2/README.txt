******************** Description of contents ********************

A folder "IFN505Assignment2" is a project folder of Pycharm (IDE).

searchalgorithms.py is the program source file that contains both experimental code and functional testing code.
In order to run the program, you will need to create "result" folder, which is pre-contained in "IFN505Assignment2" folder.
All experimental results are output in "result".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A .zip file contains original experimental results.

Four .xlsm files contain the charts shown in the report.

_count_bo_key_exist.xlsm:		Results of counting basic operation (key is in array)
_count_bo_key_not_exist.xlsm:	Results of counting basic operation (key is not in array)
_exec_time_key_exist.xlsm:		Results of counting basic operation (key is in array)
_exec_time_key_not_exist.xlsm:	Results of counting basic operation (key is not in array)

These four files contains 10 csv files corresponding to each experiment.
For instance, basic_op_key_exist_no0.csv has the first experimental result of counting basic operations.

If you would like to import the .csv files, you must run vba program implemented in the .xlsm files.
A chart in .xlsm file needs to be created manually after csv files are imported.
You will need to specify data range and data axis.
